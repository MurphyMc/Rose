Rose is the ROgue Scripting Extension.

It's a scripting language derived from and implemented in Rogue.
It is still very immature.

Rose is distributed under the Unlicense.

One way of trying it out is to clone the Rose repository into Rogue's
Source/Libraries (or symlink it there).  Then "make libraries" in Rogue.
Then compile the example Rose interpreter.  You'll need to compile the
C++ manually because you need to add the libffi library.  Something
like the following should work:

roguec rose.rogue --main
c++ -std=gnu++11 rose.cpp -o rose -lffi

Then try running the example Rose script:
./rose example.rose
